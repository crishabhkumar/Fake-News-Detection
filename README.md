<h2 align = "left">TfidfVectorizer?</h2>
# The TfidfVectorizer converts a collection of raw documents into a matrix of TF-IDF features.
TF (Term Frequency): The number of times a word appears in a document is its Term Frequency.
</br>
A higher value means a term appears more often than others,so the document is a good match when the term is part of the search terms.
</br>
IDF (Inverse Document Frequency): Words that occur many times a document, but also occur many times in many others, may be irrelevant.
