<h3 align="center">Building a model to accurately classify a piece of news as REAL or FAKE</h3>
This project will help us to deals with fake and real news.
</br>
Using Sklearn, built a TfidfVectorizer on the (news.csv) dataset.
</br>
Then,initialized a PassiveAggressive Classifier and fitted the model.
</br>
At the end,the accuracy score and the confusion matrix told how well the model fares.



<h2 align = "left">What is Fake News?</h2>
A type of yellow journalism, fake news contains pieces of news that may be jokes and is generally spread through social media and other online media.

<h3 align="center">Used in this project.</h3>


<h2 align = "left">TfidfVectorizer?</h2>
The TfidfVectorizer converts a collection of raw documents into a matrix of TF-IDF features.
</br>
TF (Term Frequency): The number of times a word appears in a document is its Term Frequency.
</br>
A higher value means a term appears more often than others,so the document is a good match when the term is part of the search terms.
</br>
IDF (Inverse Document Frequency): Words that occur many times a document, but also occur many times in many others, may be irrelevant. 

</br>
<h2 align = "left">PassiveAggressiveClassifier?</h2>
Passive Aggressive algorithms are online learning algorithms.
</br>
Such an algorithm remains passive for a correct classification possibility, and turns aggressive in the event of a miscalculation, updating and adjusting.
